# Given Question :
# 2201012_q1 :
# You are given a function f(x) = x2 - 4x + 4 where x is a real number. Your task is to find the
value of x that minimizes the function f(x) using both the Hill Climbing and Genetic Algorithm.
Use the given function f(x) =x2 - 4x + 4 as the objective function. Compare the performance of
both algorithms in terms of accuracy of the obtained solution.
# For the Hill Climbing algorithm:
1. Start with a random initial solution within the interval [-10, 10].
2. Use an appropriate step size for the algorithm.
3. Terminate the algorithm when it reaches a local minimum or after a certain number of
iterations.
# For the Genetic Algorithm:
1. Use a population size of 20 individuals.
2. Use a binary representation for the individuals.
3. Implement selection, crossover, and mutation operations.
4. Terminate the algorithm after a certain number of generations or when the population
converges.
